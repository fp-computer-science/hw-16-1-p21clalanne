### Reading Files
---
Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file named `hw16-1-#.py` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. (5 pts. each)

1. Modify the program from question 3 in HW 15-4 to read the first chapter of Alice in Wonderland from a file in the repository called `alice.txt`, instead of from the string. The output should be the same as it was for HW 15-4.

2. Write a program that prompts the user for the path to a file and then returns the number of lines in the file. Use `alma_mater.txt` and `alice.txt` to test it. You may find it helpful to use a function to count the lines in the file.
    
    Sample Input: `Enter the path to a text file on your computer: alice.txt`

    Sample Output: `There are 198 lines in alice.txt`

3. Write a program that prompts the user for the path to a file and then returns the longest line in the file. Use `alma_mater.txt` and `alice.txt` to test it. You may want to use the program from the previous question as a starting point.

    Sample Input: `Enter the path to a text file on your computer: alma_mater.txt`

    Sample Output: `'Fairfield Prep full rich in beauty,' is the longest line in alma_mater.txt`
